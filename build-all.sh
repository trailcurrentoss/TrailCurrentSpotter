#   build/spotter_merged.bin  — merged  (for web flasher, full flash at 0x0)
#
# The app-only binary contains just the application image. Headwaters OTA
# writes it to the inactive app partition via esp_ota_write, which validates
# the image as an app. A merged binary would fail that validation because
# it starts with the bootloader, not an app header.
#
# The merged binary combines bootloader + partition table + OTA data + app
# into one file flashable at offset 0x0. The web flasher requires this
# because it writes the entire flash from a single binary.
